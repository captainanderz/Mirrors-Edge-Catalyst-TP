# Updates 0.9v
* Quick TP points BETA (More to come)
* Checks if you start the program as administrator

## Not yet working
* Hotkeys with modifiers (CTRL, ALT, SHIFT)

## Common bugs
* If you dont get teleported. Try spamming the teleporter. If that does not work, die 1 or 2 times. And it should work fine.
